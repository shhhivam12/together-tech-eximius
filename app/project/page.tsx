        <h2>Preparedness as a district service</h2>
        <p>
          Proposed buyers are district and state disaster authorities, NGOs and
          relief operators. Residents access the service free.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposed first offer is an eight-week, three-site pilot:
          language-pack preparation, operator training, and a supervised
          readiness drill. Hardware is scoped and priced separately. Revenue
          combines deployment and training with annual software, content, drills
          and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Measure acknowledgement time, information availability, language
          comprehension, training time and cost per maintained site. These are
          proposed pilot measures. No customer, government partnership or
          achieved field outcome is claimed.

        <h2>Deployment architecture</h2>
        <p>
          A phone connects to nearby hub Wi-Fi. A Raspberry Pi or capable edge
          computer serves local content and queues messages. An ESP32 plus a
          separate LoRa transceiver carries compact messages between equipped
          points. Larger information and future local inference stay at the hub.
          Standard LoRaWAN is a gateway-based sensor option; the inter-camp mesh
          is a separate transport concept.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current web demo shares data through a cloud database. It does not
          provide physical radio communication. The wiring view is illustrative
          and requires board-specific validation before construction.
